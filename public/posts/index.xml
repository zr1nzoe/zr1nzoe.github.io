      <description>Update: So, apologies for a significant lack of actual content posted to this site that isn&amp;rsquo;t just OC related content, but then again I also didn&amp;rsquo;t state what i&amp;rsquo;m even doing with this site, so oh well. But anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m currently planning on using this blog much more for posting actual stuff, such as film reviews, general opinion pieces and (if I ever get the motivation to start working on some) unity/godot game projects.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I do currently have something in the works, mainly a review of a certain trilogy of dinosaur films that try and harken back to a cinema classic. Also do expect to see some creative writing pieces, as I do want to use them to explore my OCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ta ta for now ^^&lt;/p&gt;
