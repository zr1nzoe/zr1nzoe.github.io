<h2 id="about">About:<a href="#about" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Riesha Corpus, Or usually just Ri, is an undead wolf witch; The daughter of an infamous yokai, known to prey on newly wed men and unfaithful boyfriends, and a high ranking hellhound, Riesha is both a very powerful and very capable person, if she wasn&rsquo;t also a hikikomori.</p>
<p>For a while, she was the main antagonist for a children&rsquo;s edutainment series &ldquo;Ruby&rsquo;s World&rdquo;, but after a few seasons, a straight to DVD movie and a computer game too advanced for the time, the series was discontinued and fell into obscurity, save for a small niché fandom that remember the series.</p>
<p>After that time, Riesha spent most of her time stuck indoors, due to social anxiety stemming from her treatment in Ruby&rsquo;s World, leading to her status as a hikikomori.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="appearance-and-characteristics">Appearance and Characteristics:<a href="#appearance-and-characteristics" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Designwise, Riesha has Feldgrau coloured fur (#4D685A), with the exception of her lower right leg and left arm, which is more of an oxford blue colour (#0A2342), as well as having long messy orange hair (#F58F29) and Raspberry rose coloured eyes (#A53860) with black sclera. She has a very slim and slender physique, with notable stich marks on her body, as well as her lower ribs being exposed.</p>
<p>For her basic attire, she wears a pair of black high heeled boots, with orange striping going across them, as well as black stockings and a slightly oversized black shirt. She also wears a pair of black bracelets with orange gemstones adorning them, as well as a collar with a large central orange gemstone and a large witch&rsquo;s hat, adorned with the similar gemstones and a long tassel that forms into a large clawed hand.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="personality">Personality:<a href="#personality" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Riesha, at first glance, is very much a tone deaf character, being very blunt with people even if it such bluntness could mean angering the person she is speaking to. She is also somewhat of a trickster, her abilities and her sharp tongue being major tools in angering and baiting those she has taken a fancy to into a disadvantageous position. However, with those she is comfortable with, she tries her best to hold her sharp tongue, and generally cares more about their feelings. While she may be a trickster witch, she very much cares for people and is willing to do what she can to help others, even if the means of doing so aren&rsquo;t what many people would consider conventional.</p>

<h2 id="abilities--techniques">Abilities &amp; Techniques:<a href="#abilities--techniques" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<h3 id="uabilitiesu"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Abilities:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="#uabilitiesu" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<h4 id="magic">Magic:<a href="#magic" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>When it comes to the arcane arts, Riesha is one of the most powerful sorcerers in her world, being able to conjure very advanced spells with relative ease, and being able to cast basic spells as easily as reading words from a book. Her magical potential stems from her unorthodox method of focusing arcane energy, as the gaping tear in her chest is, in fact, her arcane focus. She also uses the souls of those who have wronged her, trapped inside her very chest, as boosters for her arcane abilities. Her most prominent form of magic is that of necromancy, complimenting her undead disposition; She is very capable of summoning hordes of the undead with merely a flick of her wrist, and can easily convert those who have fallen by her hands into necrotic thralls. She is also skilled in biomancy, an offshoot form from necromancy that uses flesh, bone and bile to create constructs, perform attacks or to augment herself. Besides these, she is also skilled in other elemental forms of magic, such as pyromantic magic and geomancy.</p>
<h4 id="undead-physiology">Undead Physiology:<a href="#undead-physiology" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>Due to the nature of being an undead being, Riesha gains many benefits; Firstly, she is completely immune to diseases, as her body is already dead meaning there is nothing for diseases to even infect. Secondly, she is able to recover from injuries fairly quickly, either by using her own biomancy to repair her body, or using the body parts of other corpses to repair damage done to her body. However, there is some caveats to her undead state; One key downside is that she does have a craving for the flesh of living beings. While she can mitigate this by consuming normal meat frequently and then dining on a pound of flesh from a sentient being once a month, ignoring this need can lead to her body failing to regenerate decaying flesh, as well as her mind becoming more feral. Another caveat is, due to her decaying state and her exposed chest tear, she is easily considered to many to be unsettling, as she is a literal walking corpse.</p>
<h4 id="power-replication">Power Replication:<a href="#power-replication" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>While linked to her &ldquo;Soul Equalizer&rdquo; technique, Riesha is able to gain the power and relative strength of those she has chosen to mimic. She can use this to replicate the strengths of her opponents, as well as any unique traits that they may have. One key downside to this technique, outside of the setup time needed to perform the technique, is that it does not copy the target&rsquo;s proficiency in said abilities, nor their resistances to said abilities. For example, if a power her target has requires a significant stamina draw, but the target already has gotten used to the draw, Riesha would still have to content to the stamina draw.</p>
<h3 id="utechniquesu"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Techniques<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="#utechniquesu" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<h3 id="bile-ball">Bile Ball:<a href="#bile-ball" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>Riesha users her arcane energy to form a fleshy mass in the form of a ball, which she throws at an opponent. Once it collides with an opponent, it explodes, releasing the stored bile inside.</p>
<h4 id="arcane-bouncer">Arcane Bouncer:<a href="#arcane-bouncer" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>Riesha, using the controllable tassel on her witch&rsquo;s hat (or a fleshy claw tendril, if she doesn&rsquo;t have her hat), forms a ball of arcane energy, which she throws at her opponent. The arcane energy is capable of ricocheting off of surfaces, and can be detonated upon command.Rieshaa can also use the Arcane bouncer as a form of transport, allowing her to speed across distances at high speeds</p>
<h4 id="soul-equalizer">Soul Equalizer:<a href="#soul-equalizer" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>Riesha uses her arcane energy to replicate her target&rsquo;s powers and relative strength. While she can augment said powers with her own abilities, she does still have to content with the downsides of the powers that she replicates. She also does not replicate the target&rsquo;s battle proficiency</p>
