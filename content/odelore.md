#### "Our world, even in times of peace, is a hostile one; Lawless criminals, bands of corrupt rebels and other beings that want to exploit you and everything you're worth. And who is there to stop it? We are. We, the Obsidian Scale Empire, are the ones spearheading a better future; With state of the art housing and facilities, Strong and sturdy infrastructure and developmental aid, and stalwart and dependable drones that will keep you, and generations to come, on the railroad to a better and more prosperous future" - Obsidian Scale Empire broadcast.

## About:

The Obsidian Scale Empire, or O.S.E for short, is a large villainous faction, as well as being the very faction Empress Zoe Crosse reigns over. The organization can be split into three distinct subdivisons; O.S.E Development, which focuses on building key infrastructure on both colonized and uncolonized worlds, as well as helping smaller communities before greater and more prosperous, O.S.E Expansion, which focuses on creating housing and facilities for re-creation, commerce and industry on key worlds, and finally O.S.E Military, which focuses on the expansion of the O.S.E across the galaxy, as well as all of the military backing. All of these fall under the core O.S.E Trifecta scheme, which makes up the whole of the O.S.E's philosophy.

## Drones:

Drones are the name for most of the Obsidian Scale Empire's workforce, regardless of which of the three subdivisons. Due to the complex nature of drones, such as all of the specialized types and all of the different ways drones can be created, they have their own distinct page for discussing them - [Drones]({{< ref "/odelore/drones.md" >}} "Drones") 

---

## Equipment & Vehicles:

Due to the nature of the Obsidian Scale Empire, namely their large expansive size and the different subdivisons, a large amount of equipment and vehicles is needed to keep the empire flowing. As a result of the amount of Equipment and Vehicles, this section has it's own distinct page - [Equipment & Vehicles]({{< ref "/odelore/Equipment&Vehicles.md" >}} "Equipment & Vehicles")

## Relations with other factions:

#### The Undergrounders:

the undergrounders, also known as the "People's underground resistance enclave" is a small faction of rebels cells that have banded together against the Obsidian Scale Empire. While small in numbers, they make up for this with their usage of guerilla tactics. The undergrounders are the key opposition to the O.S.E, and relations with the group have been hostile at best, and explosive at worst.

#### Haldyne Research Institute:

Despite their name, the Haldyne Research Institute is actually the name of a seperate villainous faction that opposes the O.S.E. the H.R.I initially started as an actual institute for research, with the institute producing several robotics and pharmaceutical inventions, however when the institute was revealed to have been stealing ideas from other scientists, as well as trying to "rip off" the O.S.E's drone nanites, they were quickly disgraced by the scientific field, leading to Marcus Haldyne himself to go criminally insane, and turn the institute into his own personal villainous faction. 

After a few years of the organization fighting with the O.S.E, they finally disbanded after Marcus Haldyne used his own body to pilot a H.R.I Dread Sentinel assault mech, his body being burned beyond recognition once it's fusion reactor power source went critical, as well as most of the core members either handing themselves to local authorities, or being converted into O.S.E drones. a few remnants of this faction persist, such as many of their now-abandoned bases rotting away like a carcass, as well as many malformed H.R.I maid bots still lurking the wilderness.
