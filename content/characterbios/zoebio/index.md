## About:

Zoe Crosse, The leader and the key figure head of the Crimson Scale Empire, is a large and intimidating dragon of unknown age, origin and limit to her power. While she is fully capable of going to toe to toe with stellar entities and even some demi-gods, she mostly uses her powers to rule over the Crimson Scale Empire, a multi-system spanning kingdom that she rules supreme over.

---

## Appearance:

Zoe is usually represented as a large, plus-sized black dragon, with shadings of dark grey for her wing membranes, her stomach, the under side of her tail and neck and in her large finned ears. Her head and her tail is adorned with a long, vibrant lipstick red hair, usually kept long and messy. Her body is also adorned with a pair of large wings, and a long and thick tail with a spiked end. On occasion, she takes on variations of her look, such as having three heads, a more snake-like lower body as opposed to her normal legs, and even at one point possessing a wolf-like body for a short time, however these forms are usually short live. 

Her usual, non-combative attire consists of a large black and red ball gown, with segmented sections on the main dress part of the gown, adorned with spikes, as well as a pair of black shoes with red soles and small spikes on the heel. Alongside this outfit, she also wears a pair of black bracelets and a black collar, adorned with spikes. While this dress is not used for combat, the gown's segments are actually made of a symbiotic material, that one close to a chosen target can extend out to capture an unsuspecting person.
Her combat attire, while similar in design, features a base-line underlayer bodysuit that is similar in design to those worn by her drones, albeit adorned with the red and black that Zoe uses on a lot of her outfits, as well as lacking any form of explicit control devices e.g. Control collars, Control bracelets, Control insertion toys, as well as the visor being crimson red instead of the typical light rose colour that the normal drones have.
