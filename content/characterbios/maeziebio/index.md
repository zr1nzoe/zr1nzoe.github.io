## About:

Maezie Delilah Rossi, or just Maezie, is a Feline netrunner/bounty hunter living in New Tymes City. Using her alias of "Zlyn3" in cyberspace, she fights against the dark criminal underbelly of the city, as well as fighting against the corrupt corporations that seek to turn the city into their own personal capitalist hellscape

## Appearance:

> STILL IN DEVELOPMENT<

---

## Character:

Maezie is not one to quickly open up her feelings, due to past rejections and her own personal issues, usually resulting in her keeping to herself especially on missions. However, to those who she is familiar with, she's far more eccentric and outgoing, easily making jokes with her fellow teammates and friends.

## Abilities:

## Gear & Weapons:

Both in the real world and in cyberspace, Maezie has an extensive amount of gear and weapons at her disposal, as well as different upgrades to said gear and weapons, making Maezie into a very versatile combatant.

##### Moonlight Sonata:

Despite it's macabre name, the Moonlight Sonata is a powerful photon broadsword, built out of the supposed remains of the legendary sword Caledfwlch. The sword is seemingly the only weapon in Maezie's arsenal that can transcend the physical world, following her into cyberspace. 

##### Dual Viperions:

The Dual Viperions, a pair of black and neon green machines pistols, outfitted with specialized ammunition that releases a neutralizing gas upon contact. The bullets for the viperions can be switched between a lethal .45mm round, and a non-lethal plastic round.

##### Assault Boots

The assault boots, also known as the "Assisted Surface Scaling and Utility Traversal Boots", or the "big stompers" by Maezie, are a pair of highly advanced cybernetic boots, which take the form of black studded platform boots. The boots allow the user to not only kick off of walls to gain altitude, but also allow the user to perform an in-air jump due to a series of null-gravity repulsors.

## Trivia

- Her Assault boots, albeit more based on the appearance of goth/emo platform boots, are actually based off of the Sun Greaves from the indie game Pseudoregalia, especially in how both the Sun Greaves and the Assault Boots allow Sybil and Maezie respectively to perform in-air kicks and wall kicks
- Her favorite food is Oven-Cooked chicken wings, with her favorite ones being from a small restaurant/pub called "The Drunken Maiden", where the wings in question are cooked with a crispy skin, succulent meat underneath, and sauced in a fruity and sweet but spicy sauce, served alongside a portion of chips with ranch dressing.
