# Hello!

My name is Z-R1Nzoe, but most people call me Zoe. 

I am a 24 year old Trans-woman, with a honours degree in computer gaming technology, way too much thoughts on the brain and a love for video games. I am also AroAce :3
I've been online for at least 11 years now, starting my days on the hellsite that is DeviantArt under many different names e.g. Furyfirethehedgehog, xxfuryfirexx and charmed-egg-botanist to name a few.

My main fandoms include; Sonic, My Little Pony: friendship is Magic, Five Night's at Freddy's, Team Fortress 2, Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Pok√©mon and Bionicle to name a few.
Also, while I may distain the fandom, I am by all means a furry (for better or for worse).

This site/blog is mostly meant to be a place where I can post my views on stuff without needing to release it into the hellscape that is Twitter dot com, as well as posting projects i'm working on.

I hope you enjoy the content here :D
