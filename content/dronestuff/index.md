# Crimson Scale Empire - Drone Guide:

*"If you are reading this list, then either one of two things has happened; 1. You are one of my loyal lieutenants, doing some reading on the different drone types that are at my disposal, or 2. you are a resistance member trying to search for any weaknesses in my drones. If it is the former, then I hope one of these drones may pick your fancy for whatever you need. But, if you are the latter, do know that all my files are encrypted, and any unauthorised reading by non-CSE members would have triggered the silent alarm the moment you saw the page load. By the end of this guide, a drone with a nice control device waiting to be put onto/into you is already nearby. So start running, it makes things more interesting for them". 

- Empress Zoe Crosse.*

Below is a general guide on the different drones that the Crimson Scale Empire uses within it's ranks, with stats and written descriptions of the drones details.

## Key Notes:

- When it comes to the drones, not all drones are mind-controlled into submission, as some drones are simply lower ranking members of the CSE that have not been given higher ranking role. With that being said, most drones are usually created by the method of someone being converted into one by a control device, or by direct contact or exposure with a conversion device

---

## Drone Bodysuit:

The Drone bodysuit, also known as the CSE Nanite-Fibre Composite bodysuit, is the general issue drone bodysuit used by the CSE drones. The bodysuit takes the form of a dark matte grey latex bodysuit, that covers the user's body, alongside a large visor, which covers the user's eyes. The bodysuit also has segmented sections on the hips, forearm, back and feet, as well as small illuminated segments on the wrist, the base of the heel, the hips in the form of larger disks, as well as the knee's, the breasts on female drones and on the bulge of male drones. The bodysuit also has noteable thicker band around the neck and wrists, and on the mid section of larger tails.

Despite it's suggestive appearance, the bodysuit is fully capable of providing protection to the user at a base level, due to the nanite-fibre composite that comprises the bodysuit; On a default bodysuit, the user is fully capable of resisting small arms fire, as well as high temperature extremes such as standing near a fire or in the frigid cold, and when using a mask and respirator attachment, can sustain a drone underwater and even in the vacuum of space for a prolonged time. The visor of the bodysuit is also capable of giving a constant read-out of information to a drone, such as vital signs, key mission information and even a Heads Up Display for targeting.

For those who joined the CSE willingly, the bodysuit can be easily turned into a "Inactive" form, which takes the form of a pair of dark grey bracelets and collar set, with a coloured band relating to the rank of the member, so that the drone suit can be still worn while the user is wearing other clothes. At the push of a button on the collar, the bodysuit can emerge out of the inactive form and cover the drone almost instantly. However, for baselines and unwilling drones, until a set amount of time has passed since their conversion, they are completely unable to take off the bodysuit.

## Control Devices/Conversion Devices:

Control devices and Conversion devices are devices that are used for the explicit control of a unwilling drone, and for the process of converting someone into a drone respectively. While most control devices also function as conversion devices through the method of dispersing nanites over and into a person, there are some devices that are explicitly one or the other. The main goal of these devices is to cover the soon to be drone in a layer of nanites, which takes the form of a light grey (AN: Probably a Granite #666362 or a pure gray #808080) latex-esque membrane, before re-writting their memories to make the user think highly favorably of the CSE. Once this process is complete, the baseline drone will be produced for assignment.

##### Control Collar/Control Bracelets:

The control collar and the control bracelets are the core backbone of drone conversions, due to their ability to convert unsuspecting people into drones very easily, as well as being portable and consealable. the default look of a control collar is of a black metallic collar, with a red illuminated ring running round the middle, with the emblem of the CSE adorning the front of the collar. The bracelets have a similar aesthetic, with the emblem usually being placed on the front of the wrists, however both the collar and the bracelets can alter their appearance to present themselves as other types of collars and bracelets, such as chokers, bangles and watches. Once the device is worn by a person, and senses no other people in close proximity that isn't a CSE member, then device will remove it's guise and will spread nanites other the person. Once the device has covered the person in a thick layer of nanites, it will begin the conversion process.

##### Control Insertion Toy:

Similar to the collar and the bracelets, the Control insertion toy is generally a matte black sexual toy, either a butt plug or a chasity cage, that is either inserted into the person's anus or vagina, or attached over the penis respectively. The device will then spread over nanites like the Control Collar and Bracelets. The main use-case of this device is in employ of a succubi drone, as an alternative to a control collar or bracelet.

##### Control leech:

Mainly used by a carrier drone, or by a brood-mother lieutenant, a control leech is a small robot takes the form of a long-tailed, six legged insect. The insect will use it's small size to scurry around, until it can find a good vantage point to latch onto the back of an unsuspecting victim, using it's twin stun fangs to immobilize the subject, before connecting a slim-line control collar over their neck's. Depending on the usage, most leeches are used purely for subduing a target instead of full conversion. The control leech can, if left alone for a prolonged time, disguise itself as a bracelet by rolling it's tail into itself.

##### Control Wasp:

Similar to the leech, the control wasp is a more insect-themed control device, this time taking the form of a wasp. Due to it's larger size, the wasp is mostly used alongside Hive drones and is usually also not used for stealth conversions due to the loud buzzing the rotors of the drone makes. Instead, this drone is used for fast conversion of a host, usually by dive-bombing onto the back of a unsuspecting victim, using inertia from the divebomb onto the back, a paralyzing sting from it's mandibles, and rapid insertion of a control toy stinger to quickly convert someone into a drone

##### Control Mask:

The control mask, akin to the Control Collar, Control bracelet and Control insertion toy before, is another stealth conversion and control device used by the CSE. However, the Control Mask is different because whereas the previous devices would immediately or very soon after being put on convert the host, the control masks usually take a while to convert someone as they actively re-write the host's mind as they use it. The control mask usually takes the form of a state-of-the-art smart visor, that helps the host out from day to day. Over time, the visor will alter the user's mind, making the user more and more dependent on the visor for their daily life to the point where they are inseperable from the mask. Once the mask has driven everyone away from the user, the mask will offer the user to be converted, with the mind altering leading the host to chose conversion over removing the mask.

## Drone Ranks

Not all drones are the same, and not just in what specialized role they are designed for; Many drones are ranked by their skills and prowess, especially those who are loyal followers rather than those who have been converted to the caused. As a result, many drones have a rank to them, notified by special colourations on their arms and on their augments.

##### Baselines Drones:

While not an official rank, baselines are the default drones that come from drone conversion methods. Due to their newly formed nature, they lack some of the key components of the higher tier drones, such as the augmentations given to specialized roles and a distinct coloured visor. as a result of this, baselines are more seen as unprocessed drones, rather than actual drones themselves, and are usually short lived as most baselines are given a role as soon as they return to a CSE command base. The bodysuit of a baseline in usually lighter in colouration, as well as lacking a visor like most drones. Baseline drones can also be "Feralized", where the drone's mental state is forced into only primal desires of lust, or rage. While unruly, it is effective when used to clear an entire room of people, and control collars are not readily available, as in the feralized states the claws and genitals of the baseline drone will produce nanites.

##### Rank #1 Drones:

Rank #1's are the backbone of the Crimson Scale Empire, and are the most common type of drones. A default Rank #1 will usually have a standard issue bodysuit with white markings on their upper arms and a light blue visor, as well as being equipped with a standard issue CSE-CA Standard Issue Energy Pistol, Stun Baton and at least one spare control collar or bracelet, should they need to capture an individual. As the lowest rung of drones besides baselines, most of the duties given to a Rank #1 drone will usually be more lower level, either being basic grunt work, or as assistants to higher ranked drones

##### Rank #2 Drones:

Rank #2 Drones, as the name would imply, are a rank up from a Rank #1 drone, signified by their yellow arm markings and a yellow tinted visor, as well as a more powerful CSE-CA Enhanced Grade Energy Pistol instead of the standard issue Energy Pistol. Rank #2 drones are usually in charge of groups of multiple Rank #2 drones of around 3 for smaller squads, and upto 20 for an entire platoon of drones. Rank #2 drones are also capable of taking on more advanced roles, such as commanding drone squads for combat, or as research teams. 

##### Lieutenants:

Lieutenants, or Rank #3 Drones, are the highest rank of drone that is not explicitly hand-selected by Zoe herself for that role. As a result of this, Lieutenants have more autonomy than Rank #1 or Rank #2 drones, even being allowed to control bases under the surveillance of a Relay Drone. Lieutenants are usually the apex of a drone type, but can also be in charge of large regiments of multiple drone types depending on the requirements. The Lieutenant is usually noted by having orange markings on their arms, as well as an orange tinted visor, but still only possess a Enhanced Grade Energy pistol by default. 

##### Commanders:

Commanders are not explicitly drones, but rather devoted followers of the empress herself. As a result of this, Commanders are only picked from those that Zoe has deemed worthy of the promotion. This upgrade is signified not only by having a bodysuit with red markings and a red visor, but also by having specialized modifications based on the Commander's personalities. For example, Commander Obsidian has specialized modifications into their bodysuit that allows them to attach a normally handheld rail-cannon onto their back, as well as having a deployable energy shield on their left arm. Most commanders follow a naming scheme after gemstones, to conceal their actual names.

##### Empress & Her Relays:

The empress rank is only for one person; Empress Zoe herself. She normally wears modified vibrant red version of the standard drone outfit, that includes tendril-like structures around the waist that forms into a ball gown shape, with golden spikes adorning these tendrils, as well as having red bracelets on her wrists and a collar around her neck, both adorned with golden spikes. Zoe is the only one that can actively take off her bodysuit, and if someone was to approach or damage the suit when not attached to her, it would actively attach itself onto the target, destroying the target's mind and turning them into one of her Relay drones.

Relay drones, as the name implies, function as relays for the empress' will, usually speaking for her if she is not able to be there, either due to being busy in other areas or the time to respond needing to be quicker than the speed she can make it there. Relay drones a similar drone outfit to Zoe's bodysuit, but the colouration is more in line with a standard drone, having the dark grey bodysuit, dark grey tendrils and a light blue visor. While most drones can potentially have their mind alterations reversed, Relay drones straight up destroy the host's mind, reducing them to nothing more than a puppet controlled by the drone suit.

## Drone Types:

Here are the general drone types that the CSE employs. The minimum rank of the drone will be shown by the star rating of the drone, shown after the name of the drone.

### Combat Drones:

 Combat drones are drones that are specifically focused on combat roles. These drones are noted by the green band running around their collars and bracelets.

- Soldier Drone (★)- The soldier drone is the standard military drone employed by the CSE; Equipped with a CSE-CA Standard issue energy rifle, as well as additional padding around the chest, shoulder and leg regions. These drones are designed for active combat roles, being able to take far greater hits as well as being more skilled in firearms

- Hive Queen Drone (★★) - The hive queen drone, while subordinate to the brood queen drone, are drones specifically catered around Hive drones and control wasps. Instead of having any form of firearm, they instead have a pair of wrist-mounted "stingers", designed to stun a target. Hive queens also possess a large thorax-like tail structure, which can be used to deploy several control wasps into an area for multiple drone conversion, as well as a pair of insect-like wings, that they use to fly around.

- Mimic Drone (★) - Mimic drones are drones that are specialized in the ability of replicating the movements and manurisms of a target, which is aided by a specialized transmog device, that allows them to take the form of a chosen target. The mimic drone is usually used to infiltrate groups where a succubi drone would seem out of place, or if longer investigation is needed. 

- Haunting Drone (★★) - Haunting drones are drones that are experts in psychological warfare, especially exploiting the fears and insecurities of a chosen target. Haunting drones employ a range of technology to confuse, disorientate or even "possess" a chosen target, where they then can begin converting the target

- 

### Utility Drones:

Utility drones are drones that are specialized in working in more industrial jobs, and are noted by the yellow bands running around their collars and bracelets

- Worker Drone (★) - Worker drones, much like worker drones in bee and ant colonies, function as the main laborers of the empire. Worker drones will usually be tasked for roles such as building, hauling and repair work around bases.

- Engineer Drone (★★) - Engineer drones, distinct from the combat engineer drone, are drones that are specifically catered to working on heavy machinery, such as large gun platforms, vehicles or reactors.

### Recreational Drones:

Recreational drones are drones that are catered towards recreational activities, both mundane and sensual forms of recreation. These drones are noted by the red band going around their collars and bracelets

- Succubi Drone (★) - Succubi drones are drones that take the form as a unsuspecting sex worker, and use their alluring appearance to put sexual advances onto a target, so that a control toy may be used upon them, or to discredit officials that may seek to hinder the non-aggressive expansions of the empire. These drones are capable of disguising their bodysuits into a less noticeable thin choker and arm band set, as to not draw attention to themselves. In their full drone outfit, they also have their chest and gentials exposed.

- Magician Drone (★) - Magician drones are drones that take on the appearance of a circus magician, performing inconspicuous acts of "magic". While not actively converting people, should they have suitable target, they will usually try and get the target to help perform a "dissapearing act", which they will use to apply a control collar onto them. 

### Scientific Drones:

Scientific drones are drones that are specialized in working on scientific roles, whether that may be helping with research, or actively collecting data. These drones are noted by the blue band that goes around their collars and bracelets

- Nerve Brain Drone (★) - The Nerve Brain Drone is a rare type of drone, usually only used on either converted drones of key figureheads, as a form of punishment and psychological warfare against their faction, or on drones that have broken free of their programming (a very rare occurence). These drones are put into a modified bodysuit that deprives the drone of any form of sensory feedback, while also connecting their mind into one of the CSE's super-computers, turning the brain into a highly advanced processor for the super computer, at the expense of the drone's mind.

- Data collection drone (★) - The data collection drone is used for collecting data on subjects, such as structures, planets or animals. While they do not possess any weapons, they instead have a large back-mounted sensory suite, designed to record and examine anything they are tasked with.

### Misc Drones:

These drones do not fall into one specific catergory, due to having either niche use cases, or by being more generalized. These drones are noted by having a white band that goes around their collars and bracelets.
