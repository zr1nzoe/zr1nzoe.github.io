# TALES FROM THE ASTRO-PLANE

*"In generations of old, our kinds would quarrel over magical runes, dark crypts and planar gods. And while some things may change; crossbows and swords have been replaced by firearms and electro-blades, castles and dungeons are now penthouse suites and prisons and the loot may be ID-locked before you plunder it, adventuring is still adventuring".*



Tales from the Astro-Plane is a hybrid sci-fi and fantasy story series, blending my favorite elements of fantasy stories like lord of the rings and dungeons and dragons, with the futuristic and cyberpunk elements of Blade Runner and Star Trek to create a unique story all on it's own. The stories, while usually standalone in nature, will usually have some recurring characters

## Basic Setting:

The setting of TftAP takes place in the Stellar Mesa; A cluster of solar systems, each with their species, cultures and customs. While there are alien races, most of the races in the setting are key fantasy races, such as Dwarves, Elves, Orcs and goblins to name a few, as well as other non-traditional races such as Dragonfolk, Canisborn (Anthro dog people), Feliborn (Anthro cat people) and Avairis (Anthro bird people). 



## Core Races



#### Dwarves:

Dwarves, much like their general depictions in media, are a hardy race that are as sturdy as stone in body, and in spirit. In the Stellar Mesa, they form the backbone of the initial industrial boom that lead to the unified Stellar Mesa, as well as being one of the few founding races of the Alligned Mesa Systems (A.M.S), alongside Elves, Orcs and Dragonfolk. Dwarves are usually known for their short stature, large beards, ands hearty nature, though subspecies like the Void Dwarves and Dwelfs stray from this core look.
Key members: Grimmel Cobbletongue, Kagmor Greysteel.

#### Elves:

Elves, in counter to dwarves, are a fair and sophisticated race, usually focused on pursuits of the mind then pursuits of the body. In a somewhat concerning regularity, elves seem to be gifted with access to higher politically influental careers than most other races, but there are some elves who do drift from this default path. There are many subspecies of elves, such as high elves, stellar elves and the dark elves.

#### Orcs:

In times of old, Orcs were only known for their brutish nature, seen as nothing more as hulking monsters of rage and muscle that hated anything that wasn't as green as them. In the stellar mesa, however, Orcs are the closest to being a balanced race, with orcs having equal oppertunities for hard labour work, as well as more mental laborious careers.

#### Goblins:

#### Dragonfolk:

In centuries and millenia past, dragons were only seen as colossal beings, capable of seeding great change in an area, as well as bringing destruction in their wake. These old tales of dragons are still remembered fondly, with many of these traits still applying to the dragonfolk of the present. The race, while very new and members smaller than most races, they make up for this for having quite the will to shape the stellar mesa in such a small time span. Dragonfolk are usually divided by whether or not the dragonfolk has wings or not. A very rare mutation in dragonfolk, or a blessing from tiamat herself, bestows a rare chance for a dragonfolk to be born with three heads, each head independently thinking, but also connected at the same time.
