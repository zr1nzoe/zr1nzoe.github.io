# **<u>Jurassic World, or "How to kill a franchise in 3 movies"</u>**

I want to prefice this piece by stating 2 things;

1. I absolutely LOVE Jurassic Park; I grew up watching the original 3 jurassic park films when I was a kid, and have fond memories of the films. This review, outside of mentions to the older films, will not be a commentary on those older films. This is purely focused on the newer films.

2. I do not like being a negative nancy, I try my best to enjoy the media I consume, and outside content that is absolutely repulsive, I usually do have some good things to say about most content.

I state those two things for one key reason; This review series will be my 100% honest opinions with the trilogy, both the good and the bad. If a film does something really well in my eyes, I will point it out, and equally if a film does something stupid it will also be pointed out.

## Part 0: Prelude to Jurassic World

God, 2015 was a very interesting year; It was the year Doc brown and Marty McFly travelled to in Back to the Future 2, A whole bunch of really great video games were released like Metal Gear Solid V, Undertale, The third entry in some pretty niche horror game and the first entry in Nintendo's new "Splatoon" franchise was released. Also apparently two of entertainment's biggest franchises; Jurassic Park and Star Wars, decided to start a whole new trilogy of films.

Now the idea of a fourth jurassic park entry was not a new concept to jurassic park fans; in 2003/2004, john sayels was brought on to direct a jurassic park 4, a draft script of the film being available, featuring ideas for dinosaur-human hybrids which do have images available online to show them off, and some of them are... interesting, to say the least. And even before that, there where TONNES of jurassic park 4 concept posters and trailers (the one below being one that probably decieved me when I was young, not realising it just re-used clips from the pre-existing jurassic park films, as well as the Tri-Star Godzilla film).

| It's still weird to think this tricked a lot of people more than a decade ago |

But right before 2015 even started, we did get a teaser trailer for the film, and this time it was an ACTUAL film, not some concept trailer BS. Needless to say, as a 16 year old who was a big fan of the franchise, you bet your fucking ass I was hyped as shit for the film. I can still remember the day I went to see the film, alongside two of my best friends at the time, going to see Jurassic World as a reward for doing well in my GCSEs. God now i'm getting nostalgic and also off track. 

## Part 1: Jurassic World - Bigger, Cooler, More teeth

In many ways, Jurassic World follows the coattails of Jurassic Park on a lot of different ways; From subtle callbacks to the past, to copying plot points from Jurassic Park beat for beat, Jurassic World definetly holds it's inspirations on it's sleeve. And in some cases, this does work really well; Half way through the film, the two kids Gray and Zach stumble upon the original visitors center from Jurassic Park, now in disrepair due to being abandoned for so long, but at times it can also feel like a shallow attempt to reference the past, such as with the usage of a goat and flare used to lure the T-Rex to feed infront of guests, obviously being a reference to the goat used to feed the T-Rex and the flare that malcom uses to lure the T-Rex away in the original Jurassic Park.

The film also does try and attempt at some of the subtle commentaries that the original Jurassic Park had, with it showing the failures of Simon Masrani and Hoskin's hubris in relation to the dinosaurs, resulting in both of them being killed, similar to how Hammond's hubris about having control over the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park lead to the park's down fall, as well as a bit of Anti-Capitalist themes with the film poking fun at the idea of a corporation sponosoring the existence of certain dinosaurs, an implied theme with the first 2 Jurassic Films, moreso demonstrated in Ludlow's only reason for bringing back Jurassic Park is to stop InGen from crashing and burning financially.

However, a lot of these deeper themes are surface level at best; Masrani and Hoskins do show their hubris, but it never actually gets explored or challenge (both because they end up dead before that realisation can be made), and the Anti-Capitalist themes being very ironic considering how much product placement is in the film, as well as the marketing outside of the film, including a very weird Mercedes-Benz advertisement featuring the indominus rex (somehow the second weirdest Mercedes-Benz cross promotion, the first being the promotional kart in Mario Kart 8).

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Yeah... I wasn't joking about that cross promotion                                                                           |

The story itself is interesting; not in a "actually thought provoking" sense, but in just how similar it is to the original Jurassic Park, while also changing it; Jurassic world has been open for several years, and it's only due to some super duper murder dinosaur that the park goes to literal shit, causing absolute carnage across the park, turning the park from a thriving attraction to a dead zone for obvious reasons. But while it's definetly distinct from Jurassic Park, it also feels like a pale immitation, especially in the way the characters are handled, both the human and the dinosaur characters.

Claire is probably the only character that goes through some form of an arc, starting off as a business oriented woman who cares more about profit margins and sales figures than her own nephews, to someone who genuinely cares for those around her. She's probably the only character in the film that goes through some form of arc that is explicitly noticeable. Owen, on the other hand, is very much bare bones in terms of any story; Throughout most of the story, he's portrayed as the cool raptor trainer guy, and a lot of the times he's the one that's always seemingly in the right; He's right about the Indominus being a fucking problem (TBF that could be seen a mile off), He's the only one that seems to get how much shit the park is. And ultimately, he is rewarded for this by having the generic romance with Claire (despite the two presumably dating and breaking up on bad terms). I hate to be political, but in a day and age where a gay kiss is "forced", this romance is quite literally forced and it contributes nothing.

Simon Masrani, as the replacement for john hammond, is a generally alright character; When introduced, he's quite jovial and unlike claire, he cares far more about the wellbeing of his park guests and the dinosaurs, but also is very much blind to the actual going on's behind the scenes. He is also one of the few characters that get a "Chekov's gun" death, with his over-eagerness to pilot a helicopter being what ultimately leads to his death. 

Zach and Gray are the obligatory chid characters of the films, the Lex and Tim for this film, and while they do ultimately serve to give claire a reason to go down the arc of caring about others, but on their own they don't really provide much story, with the only notable thing being about them is that the older kid is focused on teenager stuff like girls, and the younger kid is actually interested in the dinosaurs. They are not bad characters, but I wouldn't say their entirely nessesary. 

Hoskins, as well as the Indominus rex itself, encompass one of my biggest issues with this film, and why the headline of this section is "Bigger, Cooler, More Teeth"; In Jurassic Park, there was no explicit villians; Sure, the T-Rex and the Raptors were a threat, but there was not intentional malice, demonstrated with the T-Rex hunting scene. In the Lost World, this was also the case, as the T-Rexes were only attacking due to their paternal insticts, and Ludlow while trying to capture dinosaurs for a new Jurassic Park, only had his intentions of making money. In Jurassic Park 3, it was really the first time we got a purely malicious dinosaur in the form of the Spinosaurus, a dinosaur that actively pursued Alan Grant and the Kirby's throughout the film, with the pterosaur and especially the raptors only attacking due to happen stance.

I say this because the Indominus is a purely malicious entity, literally only killing for "sport" and goring anything with a pulse for no other reason than for the thrill of it, and hoskins being so dead set on using the raptors as a weapon that it's downright insufferable. In a franchise that mostly didn't need a explicit bad guy, it now suddenly has a human and a dinosaur bad guy. And ultimately, it hurts the film because instead of the problem being a matter of hubris, there's instead a single person to blame it on (especially considering the Indominus wouldn't even exist in the way it does if it wasn't for hoskins). 

The dinosaurs in general also massively suffer from the film; Back in the older films, the dinosaurs were seen as, well, animals; Some of them could be dangerous, but could also be seen just being animals. As I mentioned prior, the T-Rex hunting the Gallimimus in the first film showed the T-Rex just being an animal, no different from a lion or a crocodile hunting animals in the savannah/swamps respectively. In Jurassic World, they are only really seen as a threat such as with the dimorphodons and the pterosaurs, a background entity such as with the triceratops, or something to feels sad for such as with the apatosauruses.

The Velociraptor pack have this nature in spades, and coming off of the third jurassic park film that had really great velociraptors that were quite intelligent and showed to only be hostile due to their eggs being stolen, the Raptor squad is such a fucking let down, without even going into a debate about shrink-wrapping and feathers. The raptors in the film are quite literally trained like dogs, with owen using a clicker to get their attention and feeting them bits of meat as dog treats. And while the scene after the indominus makes them turn on the humans shows them to be vicious killers still, Especially with how they magically just fight for the good guys by the end, they feel like super heroes, more like actual animals.

And then there's Rexy... She is a plot device; As mentioned earlier, jurassic park has a paddock for her where she is basically used as entertainment for guests, and later on is let loose by claire to fight the Indominus, even being assisted by Blue in some sort of tag-team fight. And yeah, rule of cool dictates that that fight scene is, as the kids say, "Pretty fucking lit", but that's all it really is; A spectical fight, serving more to wow the people watching it than to actually have any major plot significance outside of taking out the big bad. The only saving grace is, as far as I remember, this wasn't in the marketing so it was a genuine surprise to see this fight actually happen.

In general though, the film itself does have some good elements; a foray of callbacks to the original Jurassic Park, Claire's character arc and one cool final fight, but compared to previous entries, it's very much lacking in a lot of the depth of themes that the previous movies had, trading in a lot of nuiance for more clear and distinct characters. Jurassic world is very much a more sci-fi action film than the sci-fi thriller films that came before it.

## Part 1.5: Prelude to Fallen Kingdom

Sadly unlike the build-up to the first jurassic world, I don't really have an in-depth story as to the buildup to this film; The main thing of note being that the viral marketing site for Jurassic World actually got taken over by the in-universe Dinosaur Protection group, which itself had it's own website to promote this film, which included some interesting lore details for this film, namely the key main element of the film; Isla nublar is going to BLOW THE FUCK UP! It was very much a key element of the marketing, with the main logo being shown cracked, and the teaser poster having smoke and embers. Sadly, the viral marketing site has been shut down to promote dominion, and due to the site using a lot of flash elements (which as of 2020 was discontinued).

The only other notable thing was that there was a lot of leaks of on-set photos, with the biggest takeaway being that they were actually going to use practical effects, something that were used sparingly in JW1 (and also were straight up edited over with CGI, hence why a lot of the movie looks a bit arse when it comes to the dinosaurs) and the final big bad monster was the indoraptor.

look, I won't lie; I ain't got much to say about the time between Jurassic World and Fallen Kingdom, both because it was just random leaks and because I just don't remember the hype train of that time.

---

## Part 2: Fallen Kingdom - "You've got to be kidding me"

A bit of a side note; Fallen kingdom has probably the best opening of the jurassic world trilogy, no questions asked; Even though it's mainly backstory for InGen getting the indominus rex rib that they use to create the indoraptor, the dark and forboding atmosphere and the surprise of the T-rex almost eating the guy on the helicopter's ladder before getting eaten by the mosasaurus, plus the easter egg chirps of the Dilophosaurus, its such a great opening. And if the entire movie followed this tone, this could easily have been peak jurassic world... however, things didn't turn out that way.

| ![T-RexFallenKingdom](https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/T-Rex-in-Jurassic-World-Fallen-Kingdom.jpg?q=50&fit=contain&w=1140&h=&dpr=1.5) |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TMW this is the closest this franchise will ever get to actual horror                                                                                               |

Fallen Kingdom, even since the film's launch, was also divisive due to a lot of factors in this film; As previously mentioned, the film shows isla nublar, the island that many people had grown up with, being completely destroyed and many of the dinosaurs moved to the mainland. That and quite a few other factors that we will get into later. 

One aspect that is very much distinct is the weird split nature of the film; for the first third of the film, a lot of the content is on the island, but after the 40-50 minute mark, most of the scenes are focused in on lockwood manor, as well as shifting from the normal action movie to a more horror-focused one. This shift is extremely noticeable, almost like it was meant to be two completely different movies.

Like before, Claire also seems to be the only (of the returning cast) that actually goes through something resembling an arc, with her having founded the Dinosaur Protection Group, a clear evolution from how she was in Jurassic World, where she only viewed the dinosaurs as an asset, however a later scene that I want to talk about in it's own section. And owen, is still pretty much the same character, however unlike last time the issue isn't as much that he is seemingly always in the right, but now is moreso just a generic action movie main protagonist. Oh and like last time, despite the two breaking up prior to the film, they end up back together again because the main guy always has to get the girl.

Joining claire and owen, we have Zia and Franklin, whom both work for the Dinosaur protection group and both only serve to really just be there and contribute one notable thing, Zia is a paleovetenarian and is the only character capable of keeping blue alive when she is shot by one of Ken Wheatly's men, whereas Franklin is a hacker and is used to re-enable the park's tracking system. He is also for the first half of the film a source of some of the attempts at humor in the film, and by the last act of the film are basically nowhere to be seen. 

As for the obligatory bad guys, we have Ken Wheatley and Eli Mills; Ken Wheatly is the closest thing this film has to a stand in for Roland Tembo, as he is the head of the evil bad guy dinosaur capture group, and has a thing for pulling out the teeth of some of the dinosaurs that are captured, an act that ultimately ends up being his downfall to a certain big bad dinosaur. Eli mills, if we're going by Lost World comparisons, is the Ludlow of the film, but somehow even worse in terms of writing and actions; He starts of claiming that he wants to move the dinosaurs to a "paradise" island, to save the dinosaurs, but in reality only wants them to auction them off for profit. However, in a pretty telling scene, he straight up murders lockwood after lockwood tells eli to not sell the dinosaurs.

If it feels like i'm being pretty reductive, it's because a lot of the villains don't get much development at all; they are pretty generic bad guys for bad guy reasons. Eli mills does have a moment where he does consider stopping, but whether or not it was a genuine moment of reflection is honestly unknown to me. 

Now we get to one of the biggest issues with the film; Maisie Lockwood, and Benjamin Lockwood. 
Benjamin lockwood is said to be "Dr John Hammond's former partner in develping the technology to clone", with the sole reason for them breaking off their partnership being something I will get into later. Now as far as we know, lockwood has never been mentioned so it's not like this is a major retcon, but it's still really weird to suddenly reveal that hammond had help. For most of the film, he serves as guardian figure to maisie lockwood, and then dies when eli mills truly goes "to the dark side".
Maisie, on the other hand, is an entire pallet of cans of worms; For most of the film, she is seemingly just the child of Benjamin Lockwood's late daughter, a daughter who went to the original jurassic park once... However, it is revealed by eli mills that maisie is, in fact, a straight up clone of benjamin lockwood's daugther, created using the same technology that was used to create the dinosaurs of Jurassic park. Yeah, this is actually something they went with, and shockingly, this isn't the first time the jurassic franchise tried to clone humans. Either way, it's still really fucking weird. 

The dinosaurs, compared to the first film, are still mostly just a plot device rather than the focus, only seemingly worse; Many of the theropods will straight up attack other dinosaurs even when it would make no sense; an allosaurus goes out of it's way to attack the gyrosphere claire and franklin are in, as well as the carnotaurus going out of it's way to attack the pachyrinosaurus and even owen, claire and franklin when there is a straight up eruption happening. I get that these films do take their liberties, even the original jurassic park required some leaps of logic to understand some things, but it definetly feels at times you need to turn your brain off for the film. The BIGGEST and most obnoxious example of this is how often owen manages to survive the eruption, by literally limbering about while sedate to avoid lava and also managing to outrun a pyroclastic flow.

| Protagonist-um, it's one helluva drug                                                                                                                                              |

There is also the Indoraptor; It's like the Indominus rex, but more raptor-like. There is no way to put it; this creature is less an actual animal, and straight up a movie monster. One of the biggest compliments of the film, while also being the biggest problem; In the scenes where it is stalking maisie, it is genuinely horrifying and is basically a Xenomorph in how it behaves. But at the same time, it is literally just a dinosaur xenomorph, it's barely a creature and rather a monster. The indoraptor being one of the biggest reasons why many people are now sick and tired of dinosaur hybrids.

And this leads into the BIGGEST controversial part of the film; The dinosaurs being released into the wild, or rather the way these animals are let loose; At the last few minutes of the film, Claire is given a chose; The dinosaurs that are in lockwood manor are trapped, with hydrogen cyanide gas being released into where they are. Claire can either release them or let them die, and claire does choose to let the animals die...
But maisie, has other plans; She ends up releasing the dinosaurs because "they're alive, like me". Maisie was shown earlier to like the dinosaurs, so this is in her character. I know the common complaint is that it was stupid of her to release the dinosaurs, which obviously makes sense; literally releasing dinosaurs into the world is going to absolutely fuck up the ecosystem. I don't want to beat a dead horse, so that's the most I will say. 

For as much as I take issue with the film, it's not like this film is entirely bad; The scenes at the final 20 minutes of the film with the indoraptor is legitimately scary, harkening back to the horror of the original novel. Not to mention that the ending idea, dinosaurs on the mainland, was something that the books have always played with so to finally have it be in the films in a proper capacity is something that is really great to see. If this gets paid off is for the next film. In conclusion, Fallen kingdom definetly has it's good moments, but they are few and far between what is a pretty generic action movie with dinosaurs. 

## Part 2.5: Prelude to Dominion

For a jurassic park fan, and especially after the ending of Fallen kingdom, the wait for dominion was truly something else. Throw in a pandemic that basically shut down a lot of films during 2020 and 2021, and the wait for the film was made even longer. But it wasn't like the wait was truly void of jurassic content; Jurassic World Evolution came out not too long after Fallen kingdom, and it's sequel came out a few months before dominion's release, as well as Camp Cretaceous, a more kid oriented spin-off show that is actually canon to the films, was also released. Alongside this, a part of the intended opening for the film was shown off as a preview for the film if people went to see Fast 9 (something I did alongside my dad). 
And like last time, the leaks and rumor mill also was in full effect, with many different set photos being revealed for the film, including a kinda cute picture of the Lystrosaurus from the film wearing a medical mask.

## Part 3: Dominion - "You rapacious rat-bastard"

Before I start the review, I need to mention that the version i'm watching for this review is the extended edition; Apparently during it's theatrical run, a lot of scenes that were meant to be shown in the film where strangely cut from the film; The opener with the prehistoric dinosaurs, Rexy distrupting the drive-in cinema and even an introduction to a side villain where all absent from the film's release in cinemas, but the scenes where added back into the film for it's home media release. With that said, back to the review

I want to start this review a bit differently; instead of going into the characters or a general thought of the movie, I want to talk about the dinosaurs both in terms of their designs and behaviour, and in terms of their role in the film; Now, even before this new franchise started, a lot of dinosaur fans had been ragging on how outdated the designs for a lot of the dinosaurs are now, especially the velociraptors. So when people saw the designs of the movie raptors, as well as a lot of the new dinosaurs for the first 2 jurassic world films, a lot of people called them out for good reason; Raptors don't have pronated wrists, the mosasaurus was cartoonishly huge for it's species, and as mentioned in my fallen kingdom review, a lot of the dinosaurs will straight up ignore survival instincts.

I bring this up because for this movie, a lot of emphasis was made to try and make the dinosaurs in this film "more closer to how they should look", with dodgson even stating such in the film... I bring this up, because outside of giving the prehistoric T-rex a layer of fuzz and the pyroraptor actually being feathered, they royally fucked up this notion; The starting prehistoric scene has a bunch of dinosaurs that were never around at the same place and the same time, with oviraptor eating eggs (a trait it actually never had). These issues wouldn't be so bad if dominion also didn't have some decent accuracy in how it showed off the therizinosaurus. While they did attempt for more realistic dinosaurs, it just comes off as a half arsed attempt.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| That is not a Quetzalcoatlus, that is a fucking kaiju               |

And the worst part is that, outside of that initial beginning scene, the dinosaurs are yet again only a plot device for the film; Blue is only in the film to set up Beta, a literally clone child of Blue and an in hindsight obvious allusion to a big reveal later in the movie, Rexy is only here because of course she would be for the final dinosaur fight, and a whole bunch of dinosaurs are only shown off in one single scene to be part of the big bad dinosaur black market, and then released into malta as part of some big chase scene. For the final entry, one to cap off the Dinosaur franchise, where people got to see the dinosaurs, they feel more like side character to the human cast, when in jurassic park, the dinosaurs where just as important as the humans.

Unlike last time, where I had a decent amount to comment on Claire's character but not as much on Owen's, this time it's pretty much equal in a lack of character growth or anything out side of maisie, which I will talk about later. For the third entry in the series, it does feel like the characters that were a key part of the franchise have nothing really much to say; At least The Lost World had some development with Ian Malcom, and while Jurassic Park 3 lacked depth of character, it at least made some sense with how much development hell jurassic park 3 went through.

In their place, however, we have the return of Alan Grant, Ellie Satler and Ian Malcom. Review opinions aside for a second, for the final entry of the series it's really great to see the old characters back, at least for one final hurah before they become too old to act anymore. However, as nice as it is to see them, their only reason to be in the film is for a really weird sub-plot dealing with biosyn (and dodgson, who looks way too much like Tim Cook to not be a subtle jab) creating locusts of apocalyptic nature, and Ellie and Alan sneaking around Biosyn valley to get evidence of such a thing.

Which also leads into both the primary story and also one of the biggest issues with the film; Maisie gets captured by poachers (who work for Biosyn, because if it wasn't obvious dodgson is the big bad who's only in it for financial gain), and she is taken to biosyn valley, leading to the biggest plot reveal of the film;
Maisie's mother, Charlotte, actually intentionally cloned herself in order to cure and remove a dangerous diseases her mother had. Not only that, but Charlotte actively impregnated herself with her clone. And I thought the dinosaur human hybrids of the original JP4 scripts were bonkers. And the worst part; This is a "Retcon by omission"; As far as we knew in Fallen kingdom, it was lockwood that cloned her, which caused the divide between the two gentleman, now all of a sudden, it's charlotte that's the reason there was a clone, making the two gentlemen ending their partnership to make no sense. It turns what was initially a grieving father resurrecting his deceased daughter, into said daughter using science to clone herself to cure a genetic disorder that ended up taking her life.

And if it was't obvious; despite one of the key notions leaving Fallen Kingdom and heading into dominion, people were expecting the film to focus on the idea of a world where dinosaurs were on the mainland, with the plot focusing on that. But no, instead we're focusing on maisie and her being a clone, as well as the biosyn locusts. For a franchise that's meant to be about dinosaurs, and the previous entries at least having core plotlines focused on at least something dinosaur related. Instead, the dinosaurs in Dominion are just a plot device or set dressing at best. Even Blue having a clone baby doesn't serve that much of a purpose than to correlate to Maisie. You know things are bad when the big bad dinosaurs is compared to the joker.

Dominion tries it's best to be this crowd pleasing entry; Making the film action oriented, giving us a big new scary dinosaurs as well as bringing back the old cast and the old characters, as a sort of final send-off to the franchise. But in doing so, they have to completely neglect the storyline that was already set up, rejecting a perfectly good plotline for one that is contrived and forced. I remember seeing this movie in cinemas, literally trading in two raspberry pi 4's I had (which now are stupidly expensive and rare due to demand) just to go see the movie in cinemas, and after watching it I thought it was the best way the franchise could have ended. In hindsight, I realise that it is far from the best way the franchise could end. 

In conclusion, Jurassic World Dominion is the weakest of the entire jurassic world trilogy, and is honestly the worst entry in the jurassic park franchise. It forsakes what could have been an interesting story about dinosaurs on the mainland, for another generic as all hell action movie, where dinosaurs are purely in the movie as a side order to human BS.

## Part 3.5: Post Dominion

After dominion, outside of Jurassic World Evolution 2 DLC, The rest of Camp Cretaceous, and a bunch of celebratory content for the 30th anniversay of the franchise, there's nothing really happening with the franchise right now. They did actually release a horror survival game... For the Quest 2 and later the Switch. I presume we probably won't see the next big entry for quite some time, especially as the franchise is now back to the criton estate. 

The fans, however, have been churning out some great content; from a tonne of fan art of the films and books, to some great analog horror styled content (a lot of it taking heavy inspiration from the FNAF VHS tapes), and the extremely amazing Jurassic Park Operations, a lovely fan game made ENTIRELY IN DREAMS! Sadly, Universal struck down the fan game, meaning unless they completely rebrand the game to not be about jurassic park, it will no longer see the light of day (a very real "Everyone disliked that" moment). At least the creator is still posting baller found footage style videos with the models

## Part 4: Jurassic World Trilogy - A action movie in a dinosaur jumpsuit

The biggest issue with this entire franchise, and a poison that seems to become a worse and worse element of these films, is their focus on action and thrills over anything else. I want to dub this the "MCU effect", but even that wouldn't actually do it service, and I should explain what I mean; With the first MCU films e.g. Iron man, Thor, Captain america, and even some later ones like the original Ant-Man and Spider-Man: Homcoming, while they were action films they at least had something to say e.g. Ant-Man was about scott lang wanting to be there for his daughter, which actually plays a role in the film. Captain America is about the determination and spirit of Steve Rodgers, which actually leads him to be chosen for the super soldier project and then to actually fight the nazis. But in films like Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and other recent MCU titles, outside of Guardians of the Galaxy 3 these deeper personal themes are far less prevalent, or are toned down repeats of pre-existing traits so they can focus on the cool action scenes or the funny ha ha moments that come out of nowhere.

Coming back to Jurassic World, this issue is so prevalent as time goes on; Claire starts off with an arc of going from a business first woman, to someone who cares about others, but besides the first movie and a scene at the start of the latter two, this arc is basically done with. And the dinosaurs themselves are only use to create these action scenes, or to be set dressings; The Indominus Rex, Indoraptor and the Giganotosaurus mostly take up the screentime as aggressive super-predators, or to be part of the final act's big dinosaur fight that ultimately gets killed by Blue or Rexy. Speaking of Blue and Rexy, both of them are essentially morally grey superheroes rather than actual animals; Outside of some faceless goons that work for hoskins that blue kills, Rexy and Blue are shown exclusively killing the bad guy characters, with the main good guys being either really lucky, stopping the dinosaurs or both. 

And before people mention it; Yes, the previous 3 jurassic park films are also action films, but in these films the dinosaurs were both shown to be a genuine threat to anyone, as well as being normal animals. A key example of this is the raptors in the original trilogy; The big one and her pack actively hunt in the visitor centre, even killing arnold and muldoon, but seemingly take no intentional malice outside of wanting to hunt. In The Lost World, the raptors only attack the two ingen teams due to said teams crossing their territory, and the third film especially makes the raptor's reason for hunting the main cast a direct action caused by the main heroes. Meanwhile in jurassic world, the raptors are basically trained dogs until the indominus turns them bad for a brief scene, right before the fight the indominus in the finale. 

And there is a pretty distinct reason as to why this is happening; The MCU is one of the highest grossing movie franchises, and even before 2015, the sci-fi action movie genre was talking off, not to mention writing a thought provoking takes time, and also is risky; An entire jurassic park movie that's purely horror may excite the older fans and even some newer fans, but it doesn't get the kids into the cinema, the audience that is most willing to consume the media, buy the merchandise and make money. In a fun case of irony, claire in the first film mentions how people aren't impressed by dinosaurs anymore (which leads to the indominus), because it perfectly mirrors the conditions the jurassic world movies are made under; jurassic park has been out for 20 years, with the sequels being out for at least 10 years. Dinosaurs on an island causing havoc would just be repeating what came before, and considering that action movies like the MCU was doing super well, it made sense to basically blend the two together. But in doing so, the thing that people liked about those older movies was lost, to the point where the dinosaurs are only there by obligation or to garner a "oh look, it's the glubshittosaurus from that jurassic park thing" from the audience.

## Part 5: - FIX THIS.

So, despite all my issues with the current state of the jurassic franchise as it is now, I don't want to leave this just being purely negative. I do want the jurassic franchise to come back with more movies and more content. And so, I have 3 main ideas on how the franchise can do better, amd maybe even rekindle some love from the fans;

### 1. Make a Jurassic game people want.

People have already written novels worth of words about how Universal could and should release a proper Jurassic Park themed horror survival game, especially when one they created in the past (Trespasser: Jurassic Park) is now a cult classic. And with games like the more recent Resident Evil titles and the FNAF franchise revitalizing the survival horror franchise, a survival horror game that has you exploring isla nublar while trying to survive against raptors or the T-Rex would be a dream game for many a jurassic park fan.

### 2. Do not undo Fallen Kingdom's ending

For the love of god, do not undo the world that Fallen Kingdom set up; The idea of dinosaurs on the mainland was one of the best aspects of the ending of Fallen Kingdom, and what people wanted out of dominion. Suddenly saying "Oh, all of the dinosaurs were rounded up by Fish and Wildlife and are now in Biosyn valley" is an extremely boring solution to a major event with significant rammifications. These dinosaurs should be allowed to be free roaming.

### 3. No more parks, No more Hybrids. Just Dinosaurs

We have been through the park song and dance twice now; Jurassic park happened, it failed. Jurassic world happened, and after a few years it failed. Seeing the franchise go with another park, unless there is an interesting take on the idea, is a wholely shit idea, and shouldn't happen. Same thing with the hybrids like the Indominus and Indoraptor. We've seen this before, but you know what we haven't had? people, dealing with dinosaurs. The most we had was the dinotracker and a minute at most. And if the success of prehistoric planet is anything to go by, people want to see dinosaurs just being dinosaurs. 

I'm not saying all this will be a one stop solution to fix the entire franchise's problems, but these three points are what I feel to be the best way to fix the franchise as it is right now

## Bonus Part 1: Build a Better Fake Theropod

while I did mention them before, as well as to some extent laying the groundwork for this point, but as hybrid dinosaurs... The Indominus Rex and the Indoraptor are so boring design wise; The Indominus is just a white T-rex with larger claws and camoflague, and the indoraptor is just a bigger black velociraptor that can walk on all fours and is bullet proof. With the idea of a hybrid dinosaur, the different designs could have been super out there, from a supersized quadroped carnivore with a massive frill and a chameleon tongue, to little fluffy devils that can rip a man apart, they could have easily done so much with the idea and squandered it. In fact, as the title is in reference to, the hashtag #buildabetterfaketheropod was made for those dinosaur fans that were missing out on what a cool fake theropod could actually look like

## Bonus Part 2: A diad in the Franchises

So this is a point I commonly bring up with people I know about Jurassic World; the fates of the Jurassic World franchise and the sequel trilogy of Star Wars are so similar it's not even funny; Both are vintage sci-fi franchise that had medicore yet beloved entries in the late 1990s/early 2000s, both of them have a first entry that brings back the plot line of the first entry in the entire franchise with a new cast, alongside returning classic characters, a second entry that is highly divisive due to some major story points, and a third entry that tries to round out the franchises by bringing back a classic villain, all with a streaming only TV show that is shockingly far better than the movies that came out at the time. Oh, and MCU fanboys will get pissy if you point out how these franchise have been "milked dry" but the MCU somehow doesn't get the same treatment.

Okay so some of that is in jest and there are some key differences; Jurassic world wasn't dragged into the online culture war as hard as star wars, and outside of the mobile games Jurassic world didn't have any highly controversial FPS games. But also Star Wars had other smaller films alongside the sequel trilogy, and Star Wars actually has future plans unlike Jurassic world. It's more of a fun coincidence that I like to point out, more than something concrete.

## Conclusion:

As I said before, when I was a young teenager, I was enammered by the idea of a full trilogy of jurassic world movies, as the franchise I grew up with was finally getting some new content. But as I grow older, I can definetly tell that these films weren't what I was hoping for. A part of that is generally my tastes in movies changing, and a part of that is realising that maybe the content I used to like just wasn't as good. I think this is why I think content should be reviewed again, after some time has passed; What may be good 10 years ago may not be as great as you thought. 

In terms of the franchise, I don't hate it, but it's definetly a far cry from the magnum opus that started it all, or even the two sequels that came after jurassic park. As popcorn flicks, they work fine enough, but that's all the jurassic world movies are; popcorn flicks to draw people in to watch, so a big corporation can make money. And to some, that's all a movie needs to be, but for people like me, I like a bit of spice with my popcorn, and a bit of depth in my movies. 

I won't give this film a number out of ten, or a rating (because rating shit is annoying), but what I will say is that these movies are decent films, but only when viewed from the lense of a popcorn flick

Hey, thanks for reading through this entire review ^^
For now, I'm probably going to focus on some other things before I even start another review. If I do another review, it'll either be an inverse of this talking about the jurassic park films, or on a completely different film.
