# **<u>The Culture War is a huge crock of shit, and here's why:</u>**

> **Warning:** The content mentioned in this piece will include content that either is, or references media many may find offensive. If you are not a fan of the subjects mentioned, I suggest going to a different post.

I remembe when I first started browsing the internet, back in the days of 2010-2013, a lot of the content that people consumed was general not made with a perticular political leaning in mind. Sure, a lot of stuff was edgy, while others weren't, but generally media was just that; media.

Jump forward 10 years later, and now everything has to relate to some form of political leaning, or is secretly a part of some "agenda" to do shit like "erase the white man" or some bull shit like that, and if it wasn't, it was saying how people who identify as the gender they weren't assigned as at birth were somehow a part of some mass group that wanted to sexually assault your children or something like that.

In short; The culture war happened.

The culture war, or moreso the american culture war because let's be honest it's mostly just america's bullshit going international, is the general idea of two key political sides, using the culture and media as a way to signal their virtues and spread their messages. For this current culture war, it's against the "woke" left leaning people, versus the nationalist right. And oh boy does this bullshit leak everywhere.

Now, I will state my general beliefs here; I believe that everyone has the right to exist, the right to speak their mind, and the right to do as they please, unless their actions to do all three endangers others. And if it wasn't obvious; I support Trans Rights, I support the general BLM protests, and I support the migrants that come to the UK seeking a better life.

At the same time, however, I also think that people should be allowed to make edgy jokes, I do think that people should be allowed to consume media that is linked to a controversial figure, and I generally think that people who try and "cancel" others for doing those two things are only doing it to make themselves look virtuous. 

And in a lot of the media we consume, this culture war is still in place; Both in the media itself, and in how people react to the media. One key example of this is the recent McDonalds japan advert; It's literally just a small japanese family of a mom, dad, and daughter, enjoying some McDonalds with the little halloween toys (which is why the ad exists in the first place).

It's a very simple advert, completely inoffensive in any way, shape or form... But because we live in 2023, suddenly you have dozens of far right political accounts claiming that this ad's existence is "beating the WOKE lefits mob" or "promoting the TRUE PROPER family, not some liberal transgender cult Bullshit", or generally to that effect. A cute simple ad gets turned into a battleground for some bigoted dumb fucks to cry about people that aren't cis het straight white people existing (usually far more mask off than even my example statements).

At the same time, however, god forbid you even play a video game that is even remotely related to a billionaire author that said some shitty things about trans people (despite the studio that made the game saying they never even consulted her for the game), because if you dare touch that game, you're enabling her (even though said author has already made millions off of the franchise and will probably continue to do so for the next decade).

And sadly, this isn't even a new occurence; I still remember when mentioning liking steven universe openly would get you mocked due for the show having the gaul to be somewhat left leaning, or if you dared still watch a controversial youtuber like Jontron, you would be taked over the fucking weeds for doing such an act. 

And the worst part is that if you do anything wrong on either side, say goodbye to your privacy because both sides will HAPPILY dig up shit about you. Said something bad about a political figure head? Say hi to your home address being leaked. Donated to your preferred politician that doesn't alight politically with some people? Hope your like your family being dragged into this shit for no reason.

And it fucking sucks. I don't want to spend all my time wondering if what i'm going to say will piss off some people who clearly need to touch some fucking grass. I don't want to have to make sure that the content I make is done a specific way, need I get lumped into a group. 

And yes, I know that acting like these two sides are the same entirely is very erroneous; I know for a fact that one of these sides supports the bad man with the quirky facial hair, and the other side doesn't, not to mention said side also actively goes against my views of "as long as your actions don't hurt people, do as you will". But the way both sides can act; From the verbal abuse, to the doxxing, to the fighting over media like it's the beaches of normandy because it has some content that may lean a certain way. It's hard not to see how both sides of this culture war is BS.

And there is so much more to this topic I could discuss; I could talk about how said culture war is being used as a scapegoat for both companies and goverments, using both sides to get what they want. I could also talk about how much this culture war has caused damage, but I want to end this opinion piece;

I like games like Night in the Woods, Like celeste (even though i'm shit at platformers), and I like games like undertale, all of which have these LGBT themes, as well as stuff like the BLM mural in Spider-Man: Miles Morales, or that sneaky "protect trans kids" poster in across the spider-verse. At the same time, I also don't hate Hogwarts Legacy, I think that content like the older filthy frank videos and such are actually funny, and I don't think people like silvermane or pikamee should have been harassed for what amounts to playing a game some terminally online people don't like. People are multi-faceted in their interests, and the only way to really gauge if a person is good or not, is what beliefs they believe and what opinions they hold, not what media they consume. And if you really do hate people, just for consuming media you don't like... NGL that's more problematic than me playing a game.

### Author's Section:

Hey again. Sorry this opinion piece is a bit controversial, especially for my second post ever and the first of these opinion pieces. The next opinion piece will be something a lot more fun and hopefully something a lot less controversial.
