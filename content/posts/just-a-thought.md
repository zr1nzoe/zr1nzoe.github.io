# THE ACTUAL FLORP IS CHEESE!?

No but seriously, who in the mother fuck actually discovered cheese!?
Like, considering we have to use rennet, a substance only found in the stomaches of baby cows, to create it, who in their god damn mind discovered it?
Also whomst the fuck thought putting maggots in cheese was a good culinary idea!?
