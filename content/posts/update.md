### Update:

So, apologies for a significant lack of actual content posted to this site that isn't just OC related content, but then again I also didn't state what i'm even doing with this site, so oh well.
But anyway, I'm currently planning on using this blog much more for posting actual stuff, such as film reviews, general opinion pieces and (if I ever get the motivation to start working on some) unity/godot game projects.

I do currently have something in the works, mainly a review of a certain trilogy of dinosaur films that try and harken back to a cinema classic. Also do expect to see some creative writing pieces, as I do want to use them to explore my OCs.


Ta ta for now ^^
